# Version 0.4.15
## Fixes: Pose Studio Tab State and Workflow Size

*   **Fix: Frame zoom and position lost on tab switch**: When adjusting the capture frame (zoom/offset) without moving any bones, the viewer's internal `cameraParams` remained stale. On tab switch, `getPose()` saved these stale params, so returning to the tab restored the wrong frame. Fixed by always reading `exportParams` (the authoritative widget state) as the source of truth when saving a pose — in `switchTab`, `addTab`, and `syncToNode`.

*   **Fix: Copy/Paste ignoring frame settings**: `copyPose` saved the pose using the potentially stale viewer-internal `cameraParams`, and `pastePose` did not restore frame zoom/offset to the widget or viewport. Both are now fixed: copy captures current `exportParams`, paste restores zoom/offset sliders and calls `snapToCaptureCamera`.

*   **Fix: "Failed to save workflow draft" with 4+ poses**: Captured images (base64 PNG, ~500 KB each at 1024×1024) were being serialized into the `pose_data` widget on every sync, quickly exceeding ComfyUI's localStorage limit. Captured images are now kept only in JS memory (`poseCaptures`) and injected directly into the execution upload payload at queue time — the widget no longer stores them.

*   **Fix: All poses captured with wrong frame on queue**: During full capture (`syncToNode(true)`), every pose was rendered using the global `exportParams.cam_zoom/offset` (the active tab's settings) instead of each pose's own saved `cameraParams`. Each pose is now captured with its own frame zoom and offset.

# Version 0.4.14
## Fix: Root Bone Drift on Age Change
*   **Fix: Model floating above root bone**: When changing the AGE parameter, the mesh would shrink but the root bone stayed at the old position, causing the model to appear floating. This was caused by stale absolute IK positions (`hipBonePosition`, `ikEffectorPositions`, `poleTargetPositions`) being restored from saved pose data after skeleton rebuild. Now all saved poses are stripped of absolute position data before re-applying after a mesh parameter change.

# Version 0.4.13
## Architecture: Pose Studio Core Extraction
*   **Decoupled Viewer Logic**: Extracted the core Three.js 3D viewer, IK solvers, and rendering logic from the ComfyUI widget into a standalone, UI-agnostic module (`vnccs_pose_studio_core.js`).
*   **External UI Integration**: Established a strict, configurable public API for the new core module, enabling secure embedding and full pose control in external applications without relying on internal variable hacks or ComfyUI dependencies.
*   **Strict API Contract**: Refactored the internal ComfyUI Node shell (`vnccs_pose_studio.js`) to exclusively consume the new core module via its public API getters/setters (e.g., `setSkinMode`, `setCameraParams`, `isInitialized`), completely isolating the internal rendering state from the UI application.

# Version 0.4.11
## Improvements: True Screen-Space Limb Dragging (IK)
*   **Intuitive IK Control**: Completely overhauled the IK interaction model. You can now grab and drag limbs directly in screen-space without gizmos or modifier keys. The limb smoothly follows the mouse cursor.
*   **FK/IK Seamless Switching**: Clicking without dragging instantly brings up the standard rotation rings (FK mode) for fine-tuning.
*   **Unified IK Logic**: Consolidated disparate effector update methods into a single parameterized handler and extracted complex pole-target math into a reusable helper.
*   *Credit*: This elegant interaction system was proposed and conceptualized by [DanzeluS Github](https://github.com/neurodanzelus-cmd) / [DanzeluS Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/DanzeluS/).

# Version 0.4.10
## Fixes: MIME Types and Layout Reliability
*   **Fix: MIME Type Errors**: 
    *   Moved Three.js modules to the `web` root directory.
    *   This ensures the ComfyUI server correctly identifies them as `application/javascript`, resolving "disallowed MIME type" blocking in Firefox.
*   **UI: Final Radar Scaling**:
    *   Further reduced the **Positioning Menu** (Camera Radar) size to `140px`.
    *   This prevents overflow in the 220px sidebar even when vertical scrollbars are visible.

# Version 0.4.9
## Fixes: CSP Security and Desktop Compatibility
*   **Security: Three.js Vendoring**:
    *   Resolved ComfyUI Content Security Policy (CSP) errors by vendoring Three.js and its extensions (`OrbitControls`, `TransformControls`) locally.
    *   Removed external CDN dependencies (`esm.sh`), ensuring the extension works in offline and restricted environments.
*   **Fix: Desktop Coordinate Offset**:
    *   Fixed a critical issue in ComfyUI Desktop where control points were shifted relative to the mouse.
    *   Removed non-standard CSS `zoom` and replaced it with a 1:1 coordinate mapping system.
*   **UI: Compactness Refinement**:
    *   Manually optimized the entire UI layout for space efficiency.
    *   Reduced font sizes, sidebars (now symmetrical at 220px), and internal component paddings.
    *   Refined the **Lighting Radar** and mannequin **Positioning Menu** to fit perfectly within the new narrow layout.

# Version 0.4.7
## Fixes: Workflow Loading and Model Updates
*   **Critical Fix: Workflow Crash**: Resolved a `TypeError: Attempting to change configurable attribute of unconfigurable property` that occurred when loading workflows. This was caused by a conflict with ComfyUI's internal widget serialization.
*   **Model Manager: Manual Refresh**:
    *   The "**Check/Refresh Models**" button now correctly bypasses the server-side 60-minute cache, allowing for instant discovery of new model updates on Hugging Face.
    *   Added immediate visual feedback (Loading state) when a manual refresh is triggered.

# Version 0.4.5
## Fixes & Improvements: Node 2.0 Stability and Rendering Quality
*   **Rendering: Body Contours**:
    *   Implemented a **Rim Darkening (Fresnel) Shader** for the character mannequin. This darkens the edges of the mesh based on view-space normals, ensuring body details like muscle definition and limb separation are visible even in flat white/ambient lighting modes.
*   **Defaults: Character Type**:
    *   Changed default skin type from "Dummy White" to "**Naked**".
*   **Fixes: Node 2.0 Compatibility**:
    *   Resolved an infinite node resize loop caused by layout feedback in ComfyUI's new node2.0 (Vue) frontend.
    *   Implemented robust hiding for the `pose_data` widget compatible with both legacy LiteGraph and node2.0 modes.
    *   Fixed a `TypeError` related to `serializeValue` redefinition when initializing the node.
*   **Fixes: Lighting UI Persistence**:
    *   The "**Keep Original Lighting**" button now correctly restores its visual state (toggle status and color) after a page reload.

# Version 0.4.4
## Fixes & Improvements: Smart Updates and Control Stability
*   **Model Manager: Smart HF Updates**:
    *   Implemented a throttled update strategy (60-minute cycle) to prevent Hugging Face rate limiting (429 errors).
    *   Added **Hugging Face Token** support in the new Settings menu (⚙️) to significantly increase API rate limits.
    *   Added automatic 10-minute back-off logic when rate limiting is detected.
*   **Pose Studio: Improved Bone Selection**:
    *   Rewrote the selection logic to use marker-based raycasting. Joint markers (yellow dots) are now prioritized over the character mesh, making them much easier to select from any angle, especially from the front.
*   **Interface: Control Stabilizers**:
    *   Migrated Visual Camera and Light Radar controls to **Pointer Capture**. This prevents controls from getting "stuck" or "jumping" when the mouse moves outside the node area during a drag.
    *   Fixed a bug where the camera would jump to "Wide" distance ring when the cursor left the node boundaries; it now locks distance correctly based on proximity.
*   **Settings: Skin Texture Selector**:
    *   Added a new "Skin" selector in the Settings menu (⚙️). Toggle between **Dummy White**, **Naked**, and **Marked** textures instantly without rebuilding the mesh. Selection is persisted between sessions.
*   **Lights: Default Type**:
    *   Changed the default light type from "Point" to "**Directional**" when adding new light sources.
*   **Fixes: Background Image**:
    *   Fixed background image appearing as a grey area upon initial load; it now renders immediately without requiring camera movement.
    *   Restored "Real Colors" for the background image by increasing opacity to 100% and correctly applying the sRGB color space.
    *   **Background Persistence**: The background image is now saved within the node state and automatically restored between sessions.
    *   **Auto-Preview**: Loading a background image now automatically triggers a model preview update to fix the camera frame and alignment.
*   **Fixes: Node Resize Loop (node2.0)**: Fixed infinite node stretching on systems using ComfyUI's node2.0 mode, caused by a feedback loop between canvas sizing and layout measurement.

# Version 0.4.2
## Fixes: Pose Studio Layout Stability
*   **Eliminated Resize Loop**: Refactored the `onResize` handler to stop modifying container dimensions manually. The layout now fills the node naturally, preventing infinite growth and fluctuations while remaining perfectly synced with the Three.js viewport.
*   **Performance (Resize Debouncing)**: Implemented debouncing for layout updates. The interface no longer flickers when resizing the node or moving the ComfyUI board.
*   **Cleaned Event Handling**: Removed redundant `setTimeout` chains that were repeatedly re-triggering size calculations.
*   **Dynamic Resource Loading**: Replaced hardcoded `/extensions/ComfyUI_VNCCS_Utils/` paths with dynamic URL detection. This fixes 404 errors for users where the plugin directory is named differently (e.g., `vnccs-utils` when installed via ComfyUI Manager).
*   **Firefox Compatibility**: Resolved multiple issues with the vertical light height (Y-HGT) slider in Firefox:
    *   Added required `orient="vertical"` attribute.
    *   Updated CSS with `writing-mode: vertical-lr` for correct vertical orientation.
    *   Applied `direction: rtl` to fix the inverted value direction (ensuring Min is at the bottom).

# Version 0.4.1
## Fixes & Optimizations: VNCCS Pose Studio
*   **Performance (Lazy Loading)**: The Pose Library now loads significantly faster. Full pose data is fetched only when needed (e.g., for randomization), while the gallery displays lightweight metadata.
*   **Memory Leak Fix (Three.js)**: Fixed a memory leak involving joint markers. Geometries and materials are now properly shared and disposed of, preventing gradual performance degradation.
*   **Input Offset (High-DPI Screens)**: Resolved an issue where mouse clicks were offset on 4K monitors with system scaling enabled. Replaced non-standard `zoom` CSS with `transform: scale()`.
*   **UI Lag Fix**: Debounced the data sync mechanism during slider and radar interactions. Dragging controls is now buttery smooth (60fps) while maintaining data integrity.
*   **Auto-Healing Backend**: The node now automatically detects if the 3D engine is uninitialized (e.g., after a server restart) and reloads the model before processing requests, preventing "stale cache" errors.
*   **Grid Mode Output**: Fixed `OUTPUT_IS_LIST` behavior for Grid Mode. It now correctly returns a list containing a single grid image tensor, resolving compatibility with preview nodes.
*   **Clean Prompts (Grid Mode)**: Grid Mode now generates a single, clean prompt (based on the first pose) instead of concatenating prompts from all grid cells.

## Improvements: Model Manager
*   **Smart Throttling**: Implemented a 5-minute local cache for `model_updater.json` checks. This eliminates excessive HEAD requests to Hugging Face during frequent workflow executions.
*   **Dependencies**: Added `requests` (was missing) and removed `color-matcher` (unused).

## New Features: Pose Studio Refinements
*   **Keep Original Lighting Mode**: New toggle to skip synthetic lighting in the 3D viewer, providing a clean white render while suppressing AI lighting prompts.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Overrides**: When "Keep Original Lighting" is ON, instructions like "Copy how the lighting falls..." are automatically replaced with "**Keep original lighting and colors.**"
*   **Debug Mode Enhancements**: 
    *   **Keep Manual Lighting**: Option to preserve custom lighting during randomized debug renders.
    *   **Accurate Portrait Mode**: Refined camera math for consistent upper-body framing in synthetic datasets.
*   **Natural Language Descriptions**: Refactored lighting prompts to be more descriptive (e.g., "character illuminated by...") for better SDXL/FLUX integration.

## Stability & Performance
*   **Initialization Fix**: Added a robust lighting failsafe to prevent the "black silhouette" bug on node load.
*   **UI Resizing**: Fixed a precision issue in aspect ratio calculation that caused vertical/horizontal stretching of the viewport.
*   **Library Stability**: Fixed a crash in the Pose Library grid when attempting to refresh without an open modal.
*   **Skeleton Sync**: Corrected handling of retargeted vertex weights for Game Engine configurations.

# Version 0.4.0
## New Features: VNCCS Pose Studio
The **VNCCS Pose Studio** is a major addition to the utility suite, offering a fully interactive 3D character posing environment directly inside ComfyUI.
*   **Interactive 3D Viewport**: Real-time WebGL-based bone manipulation (FK) with gizmo controls.
*   **Customizable Mannequin**: Parametric body sliders (Age, Gender, Weight, Muscle, Height, etc.) to match your character's physique.
*   **Pose Library**: Built-in system to **Save**, **Load**, and **Delete** your custom poses. Includes a starter set of poses (T-Pose, etc.).
*   **Multi-Pose Tabs**: Create and manage multiple poses in a single node instance. Generates batch image outputs for consistent character workflows.
*   **Camera Control**: Fine-tune framing with Zoom and Pan (X/Y) controls. All camera changes sync instantly across all pose tabs.
*   **Reference Image**: Load a background 2D image to trace or reference poses easily.
*   **Smart UI**: 
    *   Collapsible sections for cleaner workspace.
    *   **Reset Buttons (↺)** on all sliders to quickly revert to defaults.
    *   Auto-scaling UI that adapts to node resizing.
    *   Context-sensitive help (Tooltip-like behavior).

## Improvements
*   **Dependencies**: Added `kornia` and `color-matcher` to requirements for broader compatibility with vision tasks.
*   **Stability**: Fixed layout issues with "Delete" modal and button alignment in the web widget.
*   **Performance**: Optimized 3D rendering and texture management for lower VRAM overhead when using the Pose Studio.


# Version 0.3.1
## Changed:
### VNCCS QWEN Detailer
- **Drift Fix Logic**: Completely refactored `distortion_fix`. It now **only** controls square padding/cropping. The previously coupled logic that disabled VL tokens has been removed; the model now *always* sees vision tokens.
- **Color Match Tuning**: Reduced default `color_match_strength` from 1.0 to **0.8** to prevent over-brightening of shadows.
- **Padding Color**: Changed padding fill color from black to **white** (value 1.0) when squaring images.
- **Color Correction Migration**: Switched from `color-matcher` to **Kornia** for faster, GPU-accelerated color transfer.
- **Default Method**:  The default `color_match_method` is now `kornia_reinhard`.
- **Dependencies**: Removed `color-matcher` from requirements. Added `kornia`.

### Fixed
- **Kornia Import**: Fixed possible `ImportError` for `histogram_matching` on older Kornia versions (wrapped in try-except).

### Deprecated / Temporary
- **Legacy Compatibility Layer**: Added a transient frontend/backend fix to support legacy workflows using removed methods (e.g., `mkl`).
    - *Note: This auto-replacement logic (JS auto-fix on load + Backend auto-fix on execution) is temporary and will be removed in a future update. Users are encouraged to save their workflows with the new settings.*
